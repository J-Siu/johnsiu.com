Though I move my blog to __[Ghost](//ghost.org)__ in __[last month](/blog/ghost-blog-from-wordpress)__, I am not satisfy with the default  __[Casper](//github.com/TryGhost/Casper)__ theme come with Ghost.

With work load at job under control, I finally have time to customize it to my liking this weekend and deployed it in this site.

### Highlight of Customization

- Use __[Pixeden Social Media Font](//www.pixeden.com/icon-fonts/social-icon-font-set)__ to support LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Reddit post sharing buttons
- Support top and bottom Google Adsense
- Support Disqus comment
- Compact the overall layout and various padding and margin issue in css

There are still a few areas I want to change but will leave it as is for this weekend.

You can get this customized theme in __[GitHub:casper-js](//github.com/J-Siu/casper-js)__.
