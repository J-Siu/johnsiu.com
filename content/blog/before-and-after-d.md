Found this photo in my photo stream. It was taken more than a year ago behind my computer desk. Networking guys, look familiar?

### How was it done?

Well, it didn't happen over night. Following is recap of what I did in the past year that reduce cable count:

- **-2 cables** After sticking with wired keyboard and mouse for years, finally found a wireless one that I will give it a try, the [MS Designer Desktop (keyboard + mouse)](//www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/designer-bluetooth-desktop/7n9-00001). Its battery last, low profile, has media keys, good looking, and most importantly, it has **NUM PAD**!! That is a must for me.

- **-4 cables** [Synergy](//symless.com/synergy/) is a keyboard/mouse sharing software that works across MacOS, Linux and Windows. With it I get rid of the [kvm switch](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KVM_switch).

- **-1 pair** Enabling bluetooth audio in my Mac Mini and connect a [Logitech bluetooth adapter](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/bluetooth-audio-adapter) to my mixer. (Not exactly reduce by one as the adapter need power. But it is not running from left to right behind my desk.)

- **-3 cables** A 5.1 sound system has 5 speaker cables, a power cord and one to five inputs. With my 5.1 system dying (it produces a very annoying non-stop humming noise), I switched to a pair of power speakers. Each speaker has an input and a power cord. But the cords are not running all around my desk anymore. If you are not playing computer games nor using your computer to watch DVD/Blue-ray, just stick with stereo!

- **-1 cable** My old printer's imaging unit die and was crazily expensive to replace that part. Got a new one that support wi-fi.

What an improvement!! Hmm .. Well Done (me ^.^) !
